# sympa-contribs

A repository for contributions to Sympa that won't fit in the code but could be
useful to others anyway.

Create a directory for your contrib and please provide a README.md at the root
of your contribution to help people understanding what it does and how to use
it You can also update this README by giving a brief description of your contribution and putting a direct link to your readme file.
